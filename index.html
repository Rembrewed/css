            <h3>Design & Development</h3>
            <p>I started to learn code becuase I wanted to improve my skills and eventually switch careers. It's kinda sad that I'm only doing this now because I originally planned to do this about 5 years ago. I didn't have the money then to study and get a course. But since the pandemic, working or going to school online has been the norm. People around the world had to stay at home. Majority of studying, work and even conducting business were done virtually online. That gave me an idea of getting a course online but before I took the course. I had to go through a realization from my previous Job. I was given an offer, I had a really good salary but I had to work night shifts. I wasn't getting enough sleep and life was horrible. I have been working normal day shifts for the last 13 years and working at night was not for me. I wanted to quit so bad that it urged me get a course online before I left. Thinking that Web Development would be my next goal.</p>

            <h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
            <p>Before I took this course, I have some exposure but have little experince about writing code. It looked complicated and daunting. But when I think of the things that I went through when I was learning technical analysis in the financial markets. As well as taking in the fact the work that I do everyday as Call Quality Analyst. The amount of trouble I had gone through and still continue to go through. It gave me a sense hope that I just might be able to switch to web development. So here we are.. it's not that bad. You just have to know if something is indeed for you or not. In my case, I accepted the challenge and as a result of that. I have recently started learning basic HTML and currently exploring CSS. This is the purpose of this web site. To apply what I have learned so far. There are three fundamental tools of front-end web development html, css and JavaScript. Html and css was implemented on this web site. Next on the list of things to learn is JavaScript. Let's see I can survive that bit and find out if this really is for me or not. There is tons more to learn ahead.</p>
